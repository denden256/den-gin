          <h2 style="font-size: 15px !important;">Hello Mr. RHEGEN ALBERCA!
            You've arrived at your very own station made with love by DENISE DANE ERIDA (Hopefully Alberca in the future tehee)!
            Bantay di ka kiligon ha ðŸ˜  I made this with love and determination for almost a year na. Remember the "Den/Gin guide or manual"? Sus kalimot ka ba but I didn't! It inspired me to make this. It's been a 1-year project (mostly because I just gathered info and stuff about each other over the course of almost a year). Tuo kag ikaw ra gabuhat2 ug notes? Hmp! I'll show you! 
            
            P.S. Your reactions when I code just melts my heart. Letting you see my website also made me swell with pride and happiness. Moments like those are the reasons why the bad times only felt like fragments of the past. Thank you for giving me this idea to turn this into a website instead. I love you and happy anniversary! MWAAAAH! ðŸ˜šðŸ’• </h2>

              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> You accept my weird habits like me smelling fresh clothes before I sleep and I find your tendency to fart when sitting in a squatting position to be cute haha!</li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> We have a lot of the same interests like anime, webtoon, animals, moneeeey, good food, movies, books, writing, and MOST OF ALL, I'm interested in you while you're interested in me!</li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> We both want to grow together and achieve our dreams.</li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> We both want to grow old together.</li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> We both complement each other in the things we lack in. You don't like interacting with people too much but I do so I could handle
              anything that has to do with socializing but I suck with making organized plans while you're really good at that! I prefer a more laid-back and spontaneous approach while
              you want to always be punctual and do things on the dot. In that way, I could teach you how to enjoy things more rather than always rushing on a sched while I could learn fromm
              your sense of responsibility and punctuality.</li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> We accept each other's 'physical flaws' that we see in ourselves. You see the beauty in the things I'm insecure about, while I find beauty in yours too.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Even if we're not perfect, what matters is that we want each other.

            <h3>Why we often clash</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              I figured it might be important to be aware on why we fight often. The following points explain reasons on why we often clash with each other:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> I'm a clingy person who easily gets anxious and when I don't get my needs fulfilled, I have an avoidant response. I'm
              aware that this is not good behaviour, but I often forget when my emotions overwhelm me. It would've been nice if I could just go to your school or house
              whenever I miss you and it frustrates me that I can't. It saddens me when the only way I could spend time with you is through chat or calls. I really don't know
              how to fix this and I hope we could brainstorm together when we meet in August. If you're already reading this, it means that it's august already so let's brainstorm
              immediately! I'm sorry we always fight because of how much I'm trying to monopolize your time.</li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> When we fight, I often become too emotional while you're being too logical. I'm too focused on my emotions to listen while you're too focused
              on ending the fight to even empathize with me. I know this slowly changed as more time passed by, and I hope you'll continue to make progress in that area. I'm slowly saving up
              again for therapy to fix my mental problems since it's so hard to control it no matter how hard I try. Meditating or distracting myself doesn't work anymore. I'm sorry.. It never worked
              again ever since September so my last resort became therapy. Please be patient with me. I'm still trying to heal up until now. The things I read and found out still haunts me
              but your reactions to my scoldings breaks me too so I want to scold as less as possible.</li> 
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> We're in a long-distance relationship. Main problem in our relationship ever since the start is the distance. When I first found out that you
              were from pampanga, I was really discouraged and sad but I really liked you. </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> I was not usually jealous. In the past, I had very few arguments about other women. It was mainly because they rarely had any other female friends
              in their life. It would've been a deal-breaker for me if a guy had lots of close female friends and the fact that you have so many of them while also having history of falling for your
              female friends FOUR TIMES made me extremely paranoid. I hope you understand it from my perspective.. What if I had lot of male friends too? And I had a crush on two of them, one of them
              became my ex, and I was flirting with one of my ex-fling turned 'friend' while we were talking? My extreme jealousy only appeared because of the circumstances that came when I met you.
              Yes, I'm saying that it's your fault but it's my fault too for responding poorly to it each time but I still don't think I deserve being treated that way in the past. In short, we clash
              often because you prefer having female friends and it's impossible for you to avoid being friendly with girls while I respond poorly to it by being hostile.</li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> I suck at regulating my emotions. I'm self-destructive and often indirectly harm myself when being subjected to too much sadness and stress.
              You're a chronic worrier, and care for me so much that my self-destructive tendencies saddens you a lot. I don't know how to stop. If I don't act on my impulses, I'll go back to
              the days when I'd feel like I'm going crazy, my heart so heavy that the awful feeling doesn't go away for even weeks, cry so much that it gives me a headache in the morning, a weird
              feeling in my throat like there's something really itchy inside that I couldn't scratch at all, and sometimes a feeling of emptiness as if nothing matters anymore. It was really scary,
              and even the tiniest sign of you reverting back to how you were in the past makes me panic and want to escape. Please reassure me one more time in person. It'll mean a lot. Those thoughts
              didn't resurface at all when we met in person. </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> I suck at apologizing during an argument. I don't know how to start either on how to improve that. It's really hard. I'll try to figure this one out on
              my own, although we could still discuss about it. I've been feeling really depressed this month so I want to start therapy next month, around March or April. I'll tell you once
              I've booked an appointment!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You've been doing really great work, mahal! I'm really lagging on my own improvements so I hope you could guide me on what I should do. It's an important discussion, since my
              improvement is good for our relationship too. I'm sorry for not being able to do this on my own. I just really have no idea since all my methods in the past don't work
              anymore.
