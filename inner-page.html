              Make sure to remember and work hard towards making these things happen!
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Rhegen kinda believes astrology and he's a libra, also had a night or space-like design on his phone case (cute) so when we do get together, I hope we get to go to a planetarium</li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> He likes Bailey Sarian. Gotta watch more of her videos so we could binge watch her videos too once we get to go on youtube dates. </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> HE FUCKING LOVES GINTAMA COULD THIS GUY BE ANYMORE PERFECT?  I hope we could watch all gintama episodes together. </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> I remember he mentioned that among all his pets, he loves Lala the most and that she had a lot of adorable traits. Sanaol Lala  I hope I could meet all of his furbabies. Him being such an animal lover is making me so happy. I always wanted an animal shelter, but I like exotic animals too like bats and snakes. It might be weird that I'm going too fast but I hope we could raise furbabies together. Uh, I think it really is too fast for this point in time. I might be looking real stupid right now if we won't last. </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> We promised to create this guide together. I asked him about the progress but I don't think he made anything  I'm sad but it's okay since making this made me realize how much of pain it could be but it's starting to be real fun for me. I hope he gives me a kiss on the cheek (but if sa lips ay why not coconut) once I finish this! At the meantime, virtual kiss muna. </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> He likes Hakken a lot. I'm kind of jealous. Uh, more like really really jealous. It's making me go crazy, overthinking about if he likes cosplayers so he likes Britlen instead. I want to support what he loves tho so if we could, maybe we could wear cosplays together? I want to wear a yukata while walking with him. </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Gin loves sinigang. I don't know how to cook that recipe tho  Tas I would prefer it if I learned sinigang from his mom so that he'd find it delicious, warm, and familiar. Nobody could beat a mom's cooking after all! </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> He gave me a necklace!! A COUPLE NECKLACE ASDFGHJKL I HEAR WEDDING BELLS I shall produce a whole bottle of laway lotion for my Gin so he would skinker with it </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> He really values his friends. I understand that they're more important than me, although it really hurts sometimes but it's okay for me since I'm still someone important to him, right? At least he said that he's interested in me. I'll do my best to befriend them! </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> He likes black A LOT. I have to gather some black stuff for him but I don't know where to start  He mentioned nga picky kaayo syas clothes niya so I don't want to buy masc clothes for him na wala sya huhu ( ;-;) </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Nganong mauwaw man syas iyang novel na ipakita nako oy  Kaguol ba. ONE DAY, I'll be the one helping out with his novel and not his ate hmp. I wanna be by his side while he writes his story. Baga kog nawng magpantasya dayun nga we're living together bisag wala pay kami HAHAHHA adbans mag isip ba kay brayt man ko. </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> There are times when I feel left out when I'm together with Gin's friends, and it often makes me really uncomfortable. There were a lot of times when I felt like they were purposely ignoring me or not paying attention to what I say. I asked Gin if they dislike me but he assured me that they don't  Gin is a brutally honest person so I believe him although it makes me anxious at times. I'll do my best to take note of the stuff Gin says about his friends para di ko ma-OP next time! I bet it was just because magbestfriends sila puro while I'm still just an acquaintance to them. </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Me and Gin got together. He proposed. ASDFSGHSSKALL LORD ALMIGHTY I SHALL BELIEVE IN YOU AGAIN! Ay wait, giritwalan man to nakus Gin so basin kang satanas ko dapat pasalamat? Char basin magabaan sarreh. God, it feels so good to see him beside me and be able to see him eat the food I make. I could also just stare at him forever. How is it possibly to love someone infinitely more just by seeing their face in person? This is dangerous. Grabe kag kamandag Rhegen hiss hiss </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> I SHALL LEARN HOW TO COOK MORE SEAFOOD RECIPES!  Wala nako sya nalutoan ug calamares and other dishes tungod kay nihit kaayong time. He loves seafoods and although I'm not allowed to eat them, I could always pop a cetirizine and eat with him haha it's not like I hate seafood. The food just makes my skin really itchy, sometimes swollen, reddish, and sometimes leave scars from parts I scratch that lasts for months. Allergy is temporary, Gin is poreber. </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> I want to introduce Gin to my family and my relatives. I'll do my best so they won't say anything insensitive! I really hate how Yaya Adat says such homophobic words and iyang anak pud. I want to fight hard for our relationship to be accepted  I know Gin might think it's unnecessary but grabe kaclose-knit among family tree so basin mapugos nasad kog reunions and stuff. It's not like pwede ra nga in the future if ever maglive-in me kay biyaan ra nako syas house while naa kus daanbantayan or davao. If he doesn't want to go no matter what tho, I won't go either.</li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Gin felt sad diay when his suggestion to name Carla's child didn't go through. I'll make sure that the final decision for all our babies' names will be made my him tho of course I'll give my input too. But for our first child, I want to cherish the name he'll give even if it turns out to be something corny like "Momiming" or "Naruto" lol</li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> I feel hurt by everything but I still wanna marry this guy. He just proposed. I keep asking myself why do I still love him, but I can't deny how endearing he is. I know his bad parts of course. I'm not blind. I know what he's capable of. He's weakhearted, insecure too, could be really harsh with his words, he could do and say the meanest things to get back at me, he didn't care about my feelings, often had a hard time being gentle with his words even when I'm sobbing like crazy... I know exactly how awful he could be, dunno why I'm still here with him but I wanted to take a risk one more time. I just got betrayed by this person but all I'm thinking about is live by his side. Am I a masochist or what? IF gibotbot ra niya ning promise na pakaslon ko para ra ma-okay kus iyang mga sala, aw sige pailad sah ko ron uwu </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> I just went to my bestfriend's Hana's birthday party and she celebrated it with her boyfriend. I want that too. I want Gin to be here with me and even if it's just us two, my birthday would be much more meaningful even if it means that it'll only be us two. I feel so awful getting irritated at him when he called.. I'll try to call when I get back home. I want to celebrate my next birthday with him... • Get out of IT. ASAP. Gin really wants me to go live with him at pampanga but I'm still scared. It'd be nice if he could pick me up from the airport otw to pampanga  I'll visit pampanga around any month around 2023 so I could check for myself if I'm well-suited for the place. I'll have to work hard with my commissions so I could travel. I wonder if I should surprise him? But it'll be really scary. Who's gonna pick me up from the airport? Where am I gonna go? Yeah, I shouldn't do surprises haha ambisyosa man ko but I'm not suicidal, only a little bit suicidal maybe lol </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> The day Gin comes here to Cebu is near. I want to celebrate all of my remaining christmases in the future with him. He makes me so happy  I'm really sad.. I don't know how to tell him that I actually saw that El was unblocked sa iyang author account.. I was irritated the whole day, really upset. It felt frustrating that I couldn't tell him one of the major reasons on why I'm so upset. Why? Why did he unblock her? I can't stop crying. All the pain is coming back to me.. Basin ako pa hinuoy kasab.an nga nangabli kus author account niya without permission.. Wala raman nako nalog out sa instagram.. Makalagot. GRABE MAKALAGOT. Hapit na me magkita pero mahibaw.an nalang tawn ni nako. Why?? I CAN'T FORGET! Di nako makalimtan na tawgon niyag inspirasyon si El!

              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Get a career in which I'd be confident that I could excel at. I noticed that my marketing commissions pay really well and the clients are often happy with the results. Do I have a knack for this? I'm starting to research some more with the field. I have to take my steps now, for the future we both want. The voice recording tape he gifted me cheered me up a lot everytime I felt exhausted. Life has been really hard these days.. </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Graduate with oustanding enough grades or collect achievements to make Gin and every person that I deeply love very proud once I graduate. I want to enter clubs more, enter competitions, be more productive with my time and put more effort. I have a purpose now. I have a future to look forward to.</li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Go to Pampanga once Gin graduates and save enough money to buy a custom-made mermaid tail for his graduation as a gift. If I can't get it custom-made, I'll find the most expensive mermaid tail I could buy and I saw one in shopee. I still have a few years of searching. </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Live with him for 2 years as a college student. Unfortunately, he'd be the one working but once I get 2 years worth of experience upon graduating, I'll make sure to work hard so he could rest and work on his novel. I know life is hard and it will certainly be harder in the future but it'll be easier if it's his face that I get to see at the end of the day. I feel really guilty that he'll have to leave his furbabies, so I really have to work hard to make sure that we could provide for all of his furbabies and bring them one by one sa Cebu. I know it's so much of a hassle for him to move out here sa city so I'll be supporting him as much as I can. I feel excited just imagining being able to massage his shoulders when he comes from a hard day at work or bring him snacks and maybe a fruit milk drink while he works on his novels. Cute kaayo tong gapapak syas corned beef nako na napalpak while reading the mythology book. I already took note of foods I want to make for him para makaon niya while he's doing something like watching a movie, reading a book, or maybe working on his novel. He likes sandwiches, unfortunately di sya ganahan ug shawarma rice so I'll make shawarma nachos instead, calamares so pwd sad sya pang-finger foods, kadtong 'korokke' daw pero japanese croquette diay sya hehe, onigiris, and I'll make ramen too yet the korean kind like sa nakaon namo sa barangay seoul. I'll have fun experimenting with different recipes to give to him. Naay times na mulaag ko or muuli gikan sa school tas I'll find something na ganahan unta nako ipalit para niya, so I thought about how nice it would be if I could simply buy those stuff then give it to him when I come home. Stuff sya like flowers, saang, pungko2 foods, a cool shirt or pants which I think will look good on Gin, a weird anime eye mask, a cool silver accessory, kanang eklog na penoy, fresh milk tho lud-an na sya ana ron, black na tumbler but basically black stuff in general, or a cute notebook I want him to write on. I really look forward to it! </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Make a vlog youtube channel and tiktok accounts to record our moments. I feel guilty for fighting with him over december when we went to fuente so I'll make it up to him by recording lots and taking lots of pictures once we get to live together. I know our time was very limited before so the moment mattered to me more rather than preserving the memories... I'll try my best to make more memories while preserving them when we get together during our anniversary. I look forward to it. </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Buy a promise ring. Ever since that dream when I bought a silver ring that seemed to suit him and he turned it down thinking it was a proposal, my heart shattered. I got more and more paranoid but I need to know. When we meet in august, I'll make sure to give him a promise ring. Just looking at the ring will most likely calm me down when I'm being paranoid again.</li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> I want to create a custom-made sticker pack for us. It's still a slow progress. It might spice up our chats habang LDR me ron. I already gathered up some of his cute and funny pics, even pics of his babies too and mine. I'll turn them into messenger stickers. I might be able to finish it before the end of the year? Baga kaayo kog nawng buhat2 ani thinking it'd only take one or two months</li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> I got a gift for valentines from Gin!! It's a really cute mini film roll with our pictures! Why does he have to be sweet all the time?  I'll make sure to add more designs to the stickers pack using the pictures in the film roll. Almost 1 year and he still makes me feel like I have butterflies inside my stomach. TAKE NOTE: Add drawing with the same pictures in the film roll. How do I ask him for a gdrive of the pictures without being suspicious?  </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Actually doing those plans will be really hard but I'll have to stay strong and work hard to make it happen! Just look at his face on your wallpaper to remind yourself to push through life no matter
              how hard it gets!
